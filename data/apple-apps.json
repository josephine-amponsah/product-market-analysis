      "description": "How many negative thoughts have been endlessly repeating in your mind?  Daily affirmations help rewire our brains, build self esteem and change negative thought patterns. Empower yourself by verbally affirming your dreams and ambitions. Choose from many daily intentions and set reminders to be delivered throughout the day.\n\nPositive affirmations not only do they help make major shifts in your mindset they also serve as prompts and daily reminders on what you are truly capable of, making sure you have an amazing day, everyday.\n\nAn affirmation is a simple but powerful statement that helps to strengthen the connection between your unconscious mind and your conscious mind.\nThe more you strengthen this connection the more resilient you will be when difficult or challenging circumstances.\n\nAs Buddha wisely said: you become what you believe.\n\nAnd the best way strengthen your resilience is to practice affirmations every single day.\nThere are so many benefits of using affirmations as part of your daily morning routine:\n- They help increase your awareness of your thoughts and words making it easier to recognize the negative + self-doubt thought patterns holding you back. \n- Affirmations define your focus. When you focus your energy on the things you want: achieving your goals, the positive, uplifting + good you are creating an abundance mindset and strengthening your resolve to make it happen. \n- They open you up to possibility. Too often we get stuck in the \u2018impossible\u2019 mindset, but affirmations flip this on it\u2019s head. When you begin to positively affirm what is actually possible, a whole world of opportunity opens up to you.\n\n\nTo have access to the \"I am Premium\" content and functionality, you can choose between a lifetime, monthly and yearly auto-renewable subscription.

      "description": "BetterHelp is the convenient way to get professional help from a licensed therapist. With over 30,000 trained, experienced, and accredited therapists covering a wide range of areas \u2013 from depression and anxiety to family and couples therapy \u2013 it\u2019s never been easier to receive personal, professional help when you need it.\n\n-------------------------------------------\nBETTERHELP \u2013 FEATURES\n-------------------------------------------\n\u2022 Over 30,000 licensed, accredited, and highly experienced therapists\n\u2022 Match with the right therapist for you based on your needs, preferences and location\n\u2022 Send your therapist a message as often as you want\n\u2022 Schedule live sessions with your therapist or use the secured messenger\n\u2022 Gain access to constructive, educational group webinars\n\nPROFESSIONAL HELP, PERSONALIZED FOR YOU\nFacing obstacles alone can be daunting \u2013 receiving support and guidance from a professional therapist has been shown to make huge, positive changes to help you overcome personal challenges. When you sign up we\u2019ll match you to an available therapist based on your needs, preferences, and location. Different therapists have different approaches and areas of expertise so we\u2019ll work with you to find the right person who can achieve the best results for you.\n\nLICENSED AND TRAINED THERAPISTS\nThere are over 30,000 therapists on BetterHelp, each with at least 3 years and 1,000 hours of hands-on experience. They are licensed, trained, experienced, and accredited psychologists (Ph.D./PsyD), marriage and family therapists (MFT), clinical social workers (LCSW), licensed professional therapists (LPC), or similar credentials.\n\nAll of our therapists have a Master\u2019s Degree or a Doctorate Degree in their respective fields. They have been qualified and certified by their state professional board and have completed the necessary education, exams, training, and practice.\n\nHOW DOES IT WORK?\nAfter filling out our questionnaire, you will be matched with a licensed therapist based on your needs, preferences, and location. You and your therapist will get your own \u201ctherapy room\u201d where you can message your therapist at any time, from any internet-connected device, wherever you are. You can also schedule a weekly session to speak live with your therapist over video or phone.\n\nYou can write or talk about yourself, the things going on in your life, ask questions, and discuss the challenges you\u2019re facing and your therapist will provide feedback, insights, and guidance. This ongoing one-on-one dialogue is the foundation of your work with your therapist.\n\nTogether you\u2019ll work towards making a positive change in your life, accomplishing your goals, and overcoming your problems.\n\nHOW MUCH DOES IT COST?\nThe cost of therapy through BetterHelp ranges from $60 to $90 per week (billed every 4 weeks) but may be higher based on factors like your location, preferences, and therapist availability. Unlike traditional in-office therapy which can cost over $150 for a single session, your BetterHelp membership includes unlimited text, video, audio messaging as well as weekly live sessions. The subscription is billed and renewed every 4 weeks and includes both the use of the secured site and the therapy service itself. You can cancel your membership at any time for any reason.",

And the act of thinking in this way can be therapeutic\u2014it helps you solve your own problems.\"\n\n- Quartz\n\n\"In creating their own personal chatbots, many Replika users have discovered something like friendship: a digital companion with whom to celebrate victories, lament failures, and trade weird internet memes.\"\n\n- Wired\n\n\"Replika\u2019s growing popularity among young people in particular (its main users are aged between 18 and 25) represents a renaissance in chatbots.

      "description": "Become a better sleeper thanks to 100 years of sleep science. \n\nTeams in the NFL, MLB, NBA, MLS as well as many Fortune 500 companies trust Rise to help members achieve better sleep.\n\nFROM THE RISE COMMUNITY:\n\n*****\nChase M.\n\"Rise helped me understand how vital sleep truly is. In only a few weeks, I found myself more focused, energetic, and productive at work.\"\n\n***\nBecky G.\n\"I could see where sleep debt was causing issues, like temper short, not comprehending things, moving slowly.\u2028 I had an epiphany... I'm getting 45min more sleep on average than I was before Rise.\"\n\n****\nKatie B.\n\"I never thought too much about the impact of sleep on my mood. With Rise I saw a very fast improvement in my sleep which impacted my relationship with my kiddos.\"\n\n\u25b6 RISE Premium Features\n\nFEEL BETTER\nAre you wondering how to get the most out of your sleep? It\u2019s time to look beyond a new mattress or getting eight hours of shut eye and focus instead on your SLEEP DEBT. \n\nSleep Debt is one of the most vital findings in the last century of sleep science. When your Sleep Debt is low, your quality of life as well as your life expectancy increases. When your Sleep Debt is high, the opposite happens.\n\nWith Rise, learn what Sleep Debt is, how it works and then calculate your own. This will help you better understand why some days you feel great and others not as much. It will help you decipher when you should prioritize sleep and the real toll staying up late has on you. \n\nGUIDANCE TAILORED FOR YOU\nDo you find your mind racing just as your head hits the pillow? Unable to stop doom-scrolling on your phone until the early hours? \n\nBased on your data and the latest research, we\u2019ll make recommendations on new personalized habits that fit your needs and help you feel better immediately. \n\nHow Rise helps you sleep better:\nEncourages you to get into bed on time \nProvides guidance when you have difficulty sleeping \nReduces the amount of times you wake up in the middle of the night \nOptimizes sleep time to reduce feelings of grogginess\n\nOPTIMIZE YOUR DAY\nWe all have an internal brain clock that signals to your body when to be alert as well as when to go into recovery mode. Each body and mind is unique to another, from when we perform our best to when we should be sleeping and waking up. Given this individualization, we use advanced algorithms to highlight the optimal window for sleep and activity. \n\nAUTOMATICALLY TRACK SLEEP\nThrough our integration with Apple Health, Fitbit, Oura, Garmin, Sleep Cycle and data from other sleep trackers already on your phone, Rise can determine the hours of sleep you get every night, the number of steps you take each day, as well as data from other various activities that affect your sleep pattern.   \n\nWHY WE STARTED RISE\nWe want to help get ahead of the Insufficient Sleep Epidemic (CDC, 2014) we are currently experiencing and that has been steadily increasing since 1985. This Epidemic has led to elevated mortality rates (Cappuccio, 2010) as well as underperformance in most aspects of life (RAND, 2016).\n\nToday, we look at sleep as a luxury. Rise strives to create a world where healthy sleep is a necessity.\n\nSubscription pricing and terms:\nRise offers an auto-renewing yearly subscriptions at $59.99/yr or $35.99/yr to provide you with unlimited access to the RISE Sleep & Energy improvement membership and all premium features. We offered a limited-time free trials of 7-days to explore the Premium features for free.\n\nPayment will be charged to the credit card connected to your App Store account when you confirm the initial subscription purchase. Subscriptions automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Manage your subscription by going to your Profile page, or on the App Store Subscriptions settings page.\n\nWith your Rise Premium subscription, you may be eligible for life and AD&D insurance.\n\n\nTerms of Service available at: bit.ly/rise-sleep-app-tos.",

      "description": "This app is the remote control for all Lovense wearable toys. \n\nDesigned for:\n1.\tSolo Play\n2.\tDiscreet Public Play\n3.\tLong Distance Play\n\nUse one smartphone for close range control, syncing vibrations to music, and sound activated vibrations (uses your phone's microphone).  Range for close range control is up to 30 feet when you have a direct line of sight. 360\u00b0 range is between 5-10 feet, based on your surroundings.\n\nUse two smartphones to drastically increase your partner's control range. This is perfect for those wanting discreet public play within larger spaces. Simply connect with your partner's phone within the app and give up control! The person with a toy should have their smartphone within 3-5 feet of them at all times. The app can run in the background, so it can be in your purse or pocket while your partner has complete control via their smartphone. This feature is also great for long distance couples. \n\nYou also have the ability to create your own vibration patterns. Our fun tap and slide control interface makes it easy to make unique patterns. Our powerful vibration motor allows a large range of possibilities. After creating a pattern, you can share it (anonymously) with the world. Take a look at the vibration patterns already uploaded and download the ones you like! \n\nOther Settings (must select for each partner):\n-\tGive full control to some (don't need to continually allow them to gain control)\n-\tVibration notifications during text messages\n-\tNotifications when you partner logs into the app\n-\tAuto-play a pattern when it\u2019s sent to you\n\nNot seeing a feature you would like? Contact us at support@lovense.com! Our full time development team would love to incorporate your suggestions into our app.",

      "description": "Realize a superior clean with the new revolutionized Oral-B mobile experience.\n\nStudies show that the average person brushes for only 30-60 seconds, compared to the dentist- recommended 2 minutes. Also, up to 80% of people spend an insufficient amount of time brushing in at least one zone of their mouth. This includes 60% of people who either don\u2019t brush their back molars at all or don\u2019t spend enough time when they do[1]. \n\nAt Oral-B we strive to improve those stats to help deliver a superior clean. The breakthrough technology of the Oral-B  Bluetooth\u00ae enabled toothbrushes seamlessly connects to the Oral-B app to deliver brushing intelligence at the next level. The Oral-B app is your digital coach to help you brush correctly as recommended by Dental Professionals.\n\nBrush for a Clean that Wows\n3D Teeth Tracking and A.I. Brushing Recognition[2] guides you in real-time as you brush. This ensures you cover all areas of your mouth and surfaces of your teeth. \n\nAssess Your Brushing Habits\nPull up your brushing data summary after each guided brushing session and view your brush score to quickly see just how well you did. \n\nGet Personalized Coaching\nReceive individual coaching tips and insights tailored to your unique brushing behavior to see how you can improve the next time you brush. \n\nAccess Personalized Insights at a Glance\nBrowse through your personal brushing coverage to see which areas you need to pay more attention to. You can also view high-pressure dentition maps to learn where you need to apply less pressure and view trends based on your recorded brushing history \u2013 all easily filtered by week, month, and year. \n\nTrack Your Gum Bleeding\nThe unique Gum Guard[3] technology helps improve your brushing while protecting your gums. It includes an interactive gum bleeding tracker to help you capture instances of gum bleeding for better oral health.\n \nRevolutionize Your Oral Health\nStatistics show that brushing with an Oral-B connected toothbrush paired with the app will transform your brushing behavior. \n\u2022\tOver 90% of brushing sessions last longer than the dentist-recommended 2 minutes with almost no instances of overly applied pressure\n\u2022\tOver 82% of people who brushed with Oral-B SmartSeries experienced a noticeable improvement in their oral health[4]\n\nYou can now connect Oral-B App with Apple Health App. This helps you track and review your brushing habits on the Apple Health App. We\u2019ll motivate you to improve your brushing routine!\n\n\n**The Oral-B app connects to Oral-B iO, Genius and Smart Series electric toothbrushes with Bluetooth 4.0 compatible devices**\n**Check app.oralb.com for app availability and compatibility details**\n\n[1] Oral-B Motion Tracking Research.\n[2] 3D tracking only available at iO M9 model, AI Brushing Recognition  available at iO Series & Genius X.\n[3] Gum Guard available for all iO Series, Genius 10000 and Genius X models.\n[4] After 6-8 weeks of use.
