      "title": "Me+ Daily Routine Planner",
      "description": "\u201cWe are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act but a habit\u201d, This quote from Aristotle goes to the heart of our philosophy. We believe establishing good daily habits and healthy routines are necessary to thrive. This is what we aim to achieve: to help our users develop good habits and daily routines, like following a morning exercise routine or tidying their rooms, and to consistently repeat those actions until they become habits integrated into their lifestyle. This will enable people to lead a wholesome and fulfilling life.\n\nOf course, accessibility is important.

This will enable people to lead a wholesome and fulfilling life.<br><br>Of course, accessibility is important.

      "description": "Get to a healthier and more active life with the new Google Fit!\n\nIt's hard to know how much or what kind of activity you need to stay healthy. That's why Google Fit collaborated with the World Health Organization (WHO) and the American Heart Association (AHA) to bring you Heart Points, an activity goal that can help improve your health.\n\nActivities that get your heart pumping harder have tremendous health benefits for your heart and mind. You'll earn one Heart Point for each minute of moderate activity like picking up the pace when walking your dog, and double points for more intense activities like running. It takes just 30-minutes of brisk walking five days a week to reach the AHA and WHO's recommended amount of physical activity shown to reduce the risk of heart disease, improve sleep, and increase overall mental wellbeing.\n\nGoogle Fit will also help you:\n\nTRACK YOUR WORKOUTS FROM YOUR PHONE OR WATCH\nGet instant insights when you exercise and see real-time stats for your runs, walks, and bike rides. Fit will use your Android phone's sensors or Wear OS by Google smartwatch's heart rate sensors to record your speed, pace, route, and more.\n\nMONITOR YOUR GOALS\nSee your daily progress on your Heart Points and Steps goal. Meeting your goals all the time? Easily adjust your goals to keep challenging yourself to achieve a healthy heart and mind.\n\nMAKE ALL YOUR MOVEMENT COUNT\nIf you walk, run, or bike throughout the day, your Android phone or Wear OS by Google smartwatch will automatically detect and add your activities to your Google Fit journal to ensure you get credit for every move. Want extra credit? Turn up the tempo on your walks by starting a paced walking workout and stepping to the beat. Enjoy a different type of workout? Select it from a list of activities like pilates, rowing, or spinning, and Google Fit will track all the Heart Points you earn.\n\nCONNECT WITH YOUR FAVORITE APPS AND DEVICES\nFit can show you info from many of your favorite apps and devices to give you a holistic view of your health, so you'll never lose track of your progress. These include Lifesum, Wear OS by Google, Nike+, Runkeeper, Strava, MyFitnessPal, Basis, Sleep as Android, Withings, Xiaomi Mi bands, and more.\n\nCHECK IN AT ANYTIME, FROM ANYWHERE\nSee a snapshot of your activity history across Fit and your integrated apps in the redesigned journal.

Different therapists have different approaches and areas of expertise so we\u2019ll work with you to find the right person who can achieve the best results for you.\n \nLICENSED AND TRAINED THERAPISTS\nThere are over 20,000 therapists on BetterHelp, each with at least 3 years and 1,000 hours of hands-on experience. They are licensed, trained, experienced, and accredited psychologists (Ph.D./PsyD), marriage and family therapists (MFT), clinical social workers (LCSW), licensed professional therapists (LPC), or similar credentials.\n \nAll of our therapists have a Master\u2019s Degree or a Doctorate Degree in their respective fields. They have been qualified and certified by their state professional board and have completed the necessary education, exams, training, and practice.\n \nHOW DOES IT WORK?\nAfter filling out our questionnaire, you will be matched with a licensed therapist based on your needs and preferences.

Geocaches are created and shared by people like you, who have a passion for hiding treasure, seeking adventure, and sharing the most meaningful and creative hiding spots all over the world.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWhether you are traveling to a new city, a family out on a neighborhood walk, or a group of friends who know how to appreciate a good scavenger hunt, geocaching is easy enough for anyone to get started. Browse our map to discover hidden cache locations nearby \u2014 no matter what city or country you are in. Start by navigating using GPS-enabled directions to within 30 feet of the cache \u2014 then your real search begins. Geocaches are hidden out of sight, often disguised, to only be found by the people who are trying to find them.\n\u00a0\nGeocaches come in all shapes, sizes, and types \u2014 and some may be more cleverly deceptive than you can even imagine. Cache owners will always include a log book for you to sign to record your successful find. Larger containers might also include some treasures to be traded or moved to other cache locations \u2014 like with trackable tags, personal keepsakes, and the occasional geocoin hoping to be passed on to the next adventurer. Once you are done with the container, simply place it back exactly as you found it for the next explorer to discover.\n\u00a0\nWith a constantly growing community of geocachers there is no limit to how you can get in on the fun. You can play as a family in your neighborhood and parks, add some cache seeking to your jogging or fitness routine, or challenge yourself with some all-terrain caches on a hike near your favorite trails. Use the map to find local events held by the community around the world to learn the best tips and tricks for finding caches and the impact this global game has had on their lives. If you\u2019re lucky enough, they may even share some of the TOTT (tools of the trade!) with you to make sure no treasure gets left behind on your search.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nGet more with Geocaching Premium! Upgrade to access all geocaches and extra features to personalize your experience.

      "description": "Personalized dream meanings (Chat GPT) | Explore dream themes (Dictionary) | Find mental clarity\n\nSo, what do those strange dreams really mean? With personalized meanings and therapist guidance, get to know your dreams and yourself at a deeper level with DreamApp.\n\nGrounded in tradition and backed by science, we delve into your dreams so you can understand your subconscious mind. DreamApp is a companion who will listen in a friendly manner, give advice and connect the dots between your dreams and your life.\n\nDiscovering the hidden meanings of your dreams is just the beginning. Do you need help to feel confident in your decisions? Is it difficult to find peace for yourself and your life? Your dreams may be telling you how to take on your biggest challenges. Become one with your step towards overcoming anxiety, and depression, gaining mental clarity and releasing your past.\n\n>>> Here is how DreamApp works if you break down the process into stages >>>\n\nSTAGE ONE | Dreaming and Healing\n\nLet the dreaming do the healing. Your healing journey starts in your bed when you drift off to sleep and enter a dreaming (REM) stage. It would be great to use a tracker for that. Your brain is sorting out your emotional concerns. DreamApp has little to do with this process stage, and all the credit goes to its evolution and nature.\n\nSTAGE TWO | Dream Reporting, Journaling (Dream Reader and Dreambook)\n\nWake up and make sure to log your dream report. Notice how the story you dreamed about makes you feel upon awakening. Does it define your mood for the coming day? Capture your thoughts and feelings before they fizzle out, as they most definitely will. Journaling your dreams sets the ground for asking questions like why you were dreaming, what you were dreaming and how you can use this information to make decisions in your waking life. This self-examination is crucial for noticing and further understanding the states your mind enters, whether during your dreams or waking hours.\n\nSTAGE THREE | Understanding Your Dreams\n\nGet the first raw analysis and interpretation (Chat GPT, ChatGPT by OpenAI ) of the themes that appeared in your dream (Dictionary). Using a range of AI solutions (Open AI, Chat GPT),  DreamApp will analyze (use Analyzer) and interpret your dream to give you a rough idea of why you might have dreamed what you dreamed. You will get \u201cthe meaning of your dream\u201d with an important caveat that there are no universal meanings (the realm of horoscopes). There are rather dream patterns that can point towards some common emotional concerns reflected in common dreams. Unlike reading your lab exam results, the chart will only show you the statistical norm across the studied populations, and any actionable recommendations can only be prescribed to you according to your specific state and history of health and illness. \n\nSTAGE FOUR | Discussing Your Dreams with a Therapist\n\nYes, you heard it right. DreamApp connects you to a board-certified psychologist specializing in using dream analysis and interpretation. It doesn\u2019t mean that DreamApp thinks you are \u201cmental\u201d and connects you to a  \u201cdoctor\u201d. It means that DreamApp believes in the immense power of honest and open conversation in a  safe and compassionate setting. DreamApp therapists are here to hear any of your concerns with zero judgment and no expectations of you. Simply put, their only job is to figure out how to make you feel better in your waking life.\n\nSTAGE FIVE | Sound Sleeping \n\nDeep, sound, restful sleep indicates a healthier, happier, more meaningful waking life. Go to sleep, relieved of the emotional baggage of complex past experiences. Find yourself dreaming and living a more content life. If anything goes wrong, go back to stage one.\n\nNext is lucid dreaming, analyzer, connecting tracker...\n\nCreate your dreambook",

Journaling your dreams sets the ground for asking questions like why you were dreaming, what you were dreaming and how you can use this information to make decisions in your waking life. This self-examination is crucial for noticing and further understanding the states your mind enters, whether during your dreams or waking hours.<br><br>STAGE THREE | Understanding Your Dreams<br><br>Get the first raw analysis and interpretation (Chat GPT, ChatGPT by OpenAI ) of the themes that appeared in your dream (Dictionary). Using a range of AI solutions (Open AI, Chat GPT),  DreamApp will analyze (use Analyzer) and interpret your dream to give you a rough idea of why you might have dreamed what you dreamed. You will get \u201cthe meaning of your dream\u201d with an important caveat that there are no universal meanings (the realm of horoscopes). There are rather dream patterns that can point towards some common emotional concerns reflected in common dreams. Unlike reading your lab exam results, the chart will only show you the statistical norm across the studied populations, and any actionable recommendations can only be prescribed to you according to your specific state and history of health and illness. <br><br>STAGE FOUR | Discussing Your Dreams with a Therapist<br><br>Yes, you heard it right. DreamApp connects you to a board-certified psychologist specializing in using dream analysis and interpretation. It doesn\u2019t mean that DreamApp thinks you are \u201cmental\u201d and connects you to a  \u201cdoctor\u201d. It means that DreamApp believes in the immense power of honest and open conversation in a  safe and compassionate setting. DreamApp therapists are here to hear any of your concerns with zero judgment and no expectations of you. Simply put, their only job is to figure out how to make you feel better in your waking life.<br><br>STAGE FIVE | Sound Sleeping <br><br>Deep, sound, restful sleep indicates a healthier, happier, more meaningful waking life. Go to sleep, relieved of the emotional baggage of complex past experiences. Find yourself dreaming and living a more content life. If anything goes wrong, go back to stage one.<br><br>Next is lucid dreaming, analyzer, connecting tracker...<br><br>Create your dreambook",

      "description": "Mental is the only app that will train your mind to achieve peak performance in your professional and personal life using the same methods as elite athletes and Navy SEALs. Our science-backed approach will help you build mental strength, enabling you to control stress and become your most energized, disciplined and balanced self. Mental is where men strengthen their mindset.\n\nWith Mental\u2019s focus on science-backed methods, humor, and a dose of audacity, our approach will help you crush your goals in your relationships, business, sports and beyond. Join our tribe of men learning to control daily stress, develop their mindset, build mental strength, and forge the best version of themselves.\n\nGet inspired with a kick in the butt every morning with our 2 minute Daily Deuce. It\u2019s a powerful blend of science, wisdom and humor that makes you think, makes you laugh and gets you ready to take on the enemies you\u2019ll face that day. Think of it as the best, most actionable bits of a Joe Rogan or Andrew Huberman podcast, but it\u2019s shorter than your morning poop instead of longer than the Queen\u2019s funeral. The Daily Deuce combines ancient wisdom and philosophy, mixed with evidence-based science and facts, delivered with some (consensual) tickles of humor. It\u2019s the perfect way to start your day. And after each Deuce, do our quick micro-journaling exercise called The Daily Do, then get a simple yet powerful action to crush your goals from Mental's AI Coach.\n\nExperience Cold Showers training with Navy SEAL Master Chief Stephen Drum \u2014 train your mind under stress to become a Cold Warrior. Cold Showers help you train your discipline, recover faster after workouts, increase your immune system, reduce inflammation, and find unmatched mental clarity every day. You\u2019ll learn elite tactics across four areas: tactical breathing, body relaxation, self-talk, and mental clarity. Each day includes new tools across these areas, specifically designed to train your mind under the stress of the cold. By increasing stress in your training, we help you *decrease* stress in your everyday life: work stress, family stress, relationship stress, school stress. Master Chief Drum is the creator of the entire US Navy\u2019s Warrior Toughness training program, and he\u2019s bringing his deep insights and battle-won lessons to you for the first time.\n\nMENTAL FITS SEAMLESSLY INTO YOUR ROUTINE\n\nThe Mental App fits seamlessly into your daily routines. No \"10 minutes a day\" or \"an hour a week\" for this program. Zero minutes. You listen to The Daily Deuce while you\u2019re on the can. You do the Cold Showers Training during your normal shower.\n\nSUBSCRIPTION PRICING AND TERMS\n\nMental offers an auto-renewing subscription that gives you unlimited access to every protocol, coaching session and Daily Deuce available in our entire library. At just $59.99 per year, that\u2019s like one cup of coffee a month. These prices are for United States customers. Pricing in other countries may vary. The subscription will automatically renew unless turned off in your iTunes Account Settings at least 24 hours before the current period ends.\n\nJOIN OUR COMMUNITY\n\nMental was built by a Stanford Ph.D. Neuroscientist, world-leading Men\u2019s Mental Health Researchers, America\u2019s most decorated Winter Olympian, a Master Chief Navy SEAL, Silicon Valley\u2019s top technologists, and a (mostly failed) Hollywood Comedian.\n\nWe\u2019re @thementalapp on all socials.

I was having so much trouble finding foods that I could eat that I started having panic attacks. A friend told me about the Fig app & I immediately downloaded it. My life changed again, only this time for the better! Wow, not only was I able to find new foods to eat, but I also discovered many foods that I thought were okay-weren\u2019t. My health improved.
