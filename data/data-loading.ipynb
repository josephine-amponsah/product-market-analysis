We curate daily questions to spark meaningful convos.Using Agapé is as easy as answering just one question a day, but with a new person each time. Each question is based on decades of research and chosen specifically for you. Agapé’s questions are fun, exciting, and sometimes even spicey! But don’t worry, we will only send a spicy question if you're matched with your partner.Our questions will be personalized to your relationships. So you would get a different question with your mom than you would a friend or partner. Additionally, you’re only able to see each other’s response, once you have both responded.Although Agapé is easy and only takes a minute a day, it has a tremendous effect on relationships. 97% of users that we’ve surveyed report Agapé positively affecting their relationships.In addition to the personalization done by our question algorithm, you can further personalize your experience by opting into dozens of optional categories. Such as:- LONG DISTANCE RELATIONSHIPExample: What do you miss most about your partner when you are not together?- RECONNECTINGExample: Share a small accomplishment you've made recently that you're proud of yourself for achieving.- CHECKING IN Example: What do you currently wish you had more time for?- ENGAGEDExample: If you could make a special wedding vow to your partner that only he or she would hear, what would it be?- RELIGIOUSExample: What is a book, reading, passage or verse that had a profound impact on your own path?- MANAGING FINANCESExample: What are some of your biggest financial goals or aspirations?- PARENTINGExample: What is one of the ways your partner really impresses you as a parent?- PREGNANCYExample: What are you most excited about after the baby comes?And more!WHY AGAPÉ?Agapé [ah-gah-pay] is a Greek word for unconditional love. At Agapé we believe love is everything. It’s the foundation of all things good in humanity, the catalyst for societal progress, and the nucleus of human desire. That’s why we’ve created a relationship wellness app to make it easy for you to feel + show love.WHAT IS RELATIONSHIP WELLNESS?Relationship wellness is the process of actively shifting your mindset, making choices, and pursuing activities to strengthen and enrich your relationships, both romantic, familial, and platonic.A common misconception is that relationship wellness is best suited for those who are experiencing some sort of dysfunction. But just like the gym isn't exclusive to individuals who are out of shape, relationship wellness should never be limited to individuals who have relationship issues.Everyone should be actively practicing relationship wellness. Agapé makes it both easy AND fun.IS AGAPÉ FREE?Agapé is free to download and free to use. You can answer thousands of questions for free! However, there are premium categories that you can access with a subscription.If you choose to start a premium subscription, it helps support our small team, our relationship wellness research, and our app development.Agapé Premium plan payments will be charged to your iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase.

So whatever issue you might be facing - short naps, frequent night-wakings, never-ending bedtime routines - there’s a good chance we can help you too.→ Napper’s main features include…• A personalized sleep schedule for your baby based on their natural sleep rhythms and research on infant sleep. The schedule adjusts as your baby\\'s sleep needs change to promote healthy sleep habits and provide them with the restful sleep they need to grow and develop.• User-friendly, straight-forward baby tracker to help you keep track of nursings, formula feedings, diaper changes and much more. You can also share your baby (and subscription) with as many caregivers as needed so everyone is on the same page.• A large variety of sleep sounds, such as white noise, lullabies, and sounds of nature, that can be played in the background during naptime and bedtime. The sounds are carefully chosen to be gentle and calming, helping to create a peaceful and relaxing environment for your baby to sleep in.• A comprehensive, science-based article series designed to help you establish healthy sleep habits for your baby. The course covers a wide range of topics, including the basic biological components of sleep, how to create a sleep-friendly environment and strategies for settling and soothing a fussy baby.• Trends & statistics presented in easy-to-read charts that give you useful insights, such as the average amount of time your baby spends asleep, the number of night wakings, and the duration of feedings. Easily spot and identify patterns and trends in your baby\\'s sleep, which allows you to make adjustments to their sleep routine as needed.—All in all, we’d really like to think that Napper is the most complete baby sleep app out there. But don\\'t just take our word for it though - here’s what other parents have to say about it:\"Great app, helped me work out when nap times should be and helped set a bedtime routine! Definitely recommend.\"\"This is one of the apps which every mom or another caregiver should download straight away. Thanks to Napper I could develop a deeper understanding of my 4-months old sleep patterns. And now he falls asleep fast and without cries. Thank you!\"\"I love Napper! I\\'ve used 4 other sleep tracking apps (paid for) and Napper has to be my favorite! I love the aesthetic of the layout and how accurate it is.\"\"This app is amazing!! Very accurate for my son and has been for months. Great features to select number of naps and set bed time if trying to create a routine too.\"\"My baby is 11 months and I use it all day every day. Keeps us on schedule\"\"This app is really great, it\\'s like a baby manual that comes with your child! I really love it.\"\"Really useful, I\\'m sleep deprived and can\\'t remember exactly what time everything happens! The predictive sleep feature is great. Developers very responsive to feedback\"\"I LOVE Napper! I have used lots of baby trackers over my 4 kids and this one is hands down my favorite.\"\"The app is pretty great but the customer service is even better! I thought I was locked out of my account and they contacted me and got me back in within minutes! This app has revolutionized how we care for our newborn.\"\"This is the app that got us through the 4 months sleep regression! And I love that multiple caretakers can add track baby\\'s sleep. Such a great help!\"So don\\'t let sleepless nights and exhausted days be the norm - try Napper (yes, today!!) and give your baby the gift of restful, peaceful sleep!—Terms of use: https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/Privacy policy: https://napper.app/privacy',\n",
